Code Dojo #1 - Module, Events and Grunt Review
==============================================

Introduction
------------

A Code Dojo (not to be confused with the JS library [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/)) is a form of group practice. The idea originates from the [Software Craftsmanship](http://cleancoder.posterous.com/software-craftsmanship-things-wars-commandmen) movement which believes that a Developer must practice their skills much like how a musician plays scales and practices before the big performance. The set up is as follows:

* A single computer is hooked up to a project so the whole group can view the screen.
* Two people (a pair) are selected to write code first. One person sits at the keyboard (The Driver) and the other beside them (The Observer). The Driver types and the Observer watches and comments. A conversation happen between the pair about how to approach the code. Only the pair is allowed to converse about the code and only the Driver is allowed to type, so the remainder of the group is not allowed to contribute. However, everyone in the group must understand what is going. If anyone is confused they may ask a question and the Pair will answer them.
* After some predefined amount of time (5-10 minutes), the Driver steps away, the Observer becomes the Driver and someone from the group becomes the new Observer. Repeat.

The exercise is intended to mix skill levels and engage observers. Remember to make best use of all of the skills learned in the last workshops; Modules, Events and Preprocessing. See some code you dont like? Refactor it while you are the Driver.

Exercise
--------

### Basic App

* Display a grid of photos. 
* You can add to the grid by giving the app URLs. 

Much of the boilerplate is done: basic markup, initial Gruntfile, and some necessary libraries have been gathered.

### Extra Features (Time Permitting)

* When a photo is clicked, show a larger version in a modal.
* Allow photos to have captions added.
