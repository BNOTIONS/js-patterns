Introduction to Test Driven Development
=======================================

### TL;DR
### Write tests before your code.

# Red, Green, Refactor
## 1. Red

Write a failing test for the functionality you want to implement.

## 2. Green

Write just enough code to make that test pass.

## 3. Refactor

If your code is getting ugly, fix it. Ensure that all tests still pass.
